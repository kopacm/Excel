# Linear Programming

**Linear programming (LP)** is a powerful technique for solving certain types of optimization problems

## Parts of a LP Problem

There are three main parts of a linear programming problem:

- The **objective function**: The quantity to be maximized or minimized (for example, profit or cost).
    
- The **constraints**: The restrictions on the resources needed for the objective (for example, budgets or time limits).
    
- The **decision variables**: The unknowns that the manager has control over to bring about the objective (for example, number of units to produce or number of hours to schedule).

## Use Cases

I will use linear programming to help determine how to best allocate limited resources to maximize or minimize a quantity (like profit or cost).

### I solved this tasks:

1. How many ads of each type should be used?
2. How many people will be reached?
3. Maximize producation net profit
4. Maximize profit invested in stock by following guidelines.
5. Minimize the total student miles travelled by bus.
6. Minimize total costs (which include salary, hiring, and firing costs) over the next five years.




For this i used Add-on Solver :
