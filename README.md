# Linear Programming

**Linear programming (LP)** is a powerful technique for solving certain types of optimization problems

## Parts of a LP Problem

There are three main parts of a linear programming problem:

- The **objective function**: The quantity to be maximized or minimized (for example, profit or cost).
    
- The **constraints**: The restrictions on the resources needed for the objective (for example, budgets or time limits).
    
- The **decision variables**: The unknowns that the manager has control over to bring about the objective (for example, number of units to produce or number of hours to schedule).

## Use Cases

I will use linear programming to help determine how to best allocate limited resources to maximize or minimize a quantity (like profit or cost).
